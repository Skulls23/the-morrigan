Master HIC 2021-2022 Game Project<br/>
<!--REMINDER TO MYSELF : Use git lfs once the project is done!<br/>-->

## Name
The Morrígan

## Description
The morrigan is a soul-like game, made by 10 students. It allows the player to play as the young celt in a deep forest full of corrupted monsters.
The gameplay is based on fighting. Each ennemy has a weak point, if the player hit it, the monster gets a lot a damage, if the player miss it, the monster takes damage but he corrupts a heart of the player. Each time the monster hit you, you lose 1 heart and 1 corrupted heart if you got one.
This is hard and punitive, but completely intended

## Visuals
To be added

## Installation
This is the code version of the game. All this has to be added to a unity project
<!--.exe TBA-->

## Support
As a student project, there will be no support.
